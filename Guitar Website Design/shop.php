With its solid body, maple neck, oiled poplar laminate fingerboard, Korean chrome hardware and vintage hard tail bridge, this is a well-crafted and very playable instrument. The Split coil humbucking pickup with volume and tone controls means that this bass guitar is able to reproduce an authentic variety of classic bass guitar sounds. It's the crisp clear tone with good low-end depth, punch and sustain that makes it such a bargain. Sustainable Tone Woods. The range of LA guitars features sustainable wood that meets the needs of the evolving world. Composed of poplar laminate, the dense and natural grain of the updated fretboards give improved tone and volume. We oil the fingerboard so it will look and feel its best when you pick them up for the first time and will keep in great condition for longer, ensuring stability and playability.</p>
