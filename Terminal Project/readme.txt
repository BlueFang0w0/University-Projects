First off to get started open the command line and navigate to the directory of the provided files. Then simply call "make" command and the file will be compiled.

Then open the shell with "./myshell".

There are various commands you can run in my shell.

NOTE: Many of the commands will require the full path in order to operate. So for windows that would be something like c:/Users/username/desktop/workdirectory and for linux it could be something like /home/users/username/desktop/workdirectory.

-cd <directory> : to change directory. If the argument is not present, it will report the current directory. If the directory does not exist an appropriate error will be reported. This command will also change the PWD environment variable.

-cls : to clear the screen.

-dir <directory> : lists the contents of the directory.

-copy <source> <destination> : copies the <source> folder to <destination>.

-print <comment> : displays the commend on the display.

-md <directory> : creates a directory.

-rd <directory> : removes the folder if the folder is empty, will display error message if it is not.

-quit : exits the program and allows normal use of the command line.

Any additional commands should be passed to the system which will try to execute your command if my shell does not recognise your command.
